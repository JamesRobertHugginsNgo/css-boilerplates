A collection of css boilerplates that is simple to use and
customize for common use cases.

> Boilerplate code refers to sections of code that are commonly used across many projects or applications with little to no modification. It provides a standardized or template structure for developers to avoid having to write the same basic code from scratch every time. It's essentially a starting point that contains the fundamental setup or patterns needed to get something working.
